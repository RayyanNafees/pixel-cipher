# pixel-cipher
Cipher Bytes as image pixels representing integer of base 16777216 

## New Image Approach

In case the size of the image becomes very larger to hold cuz of big data, or the image processing may take longer, fuck png, and go with SVG (which just requires text processing in a file which can also be easily done via JS (or WebAssembly more efficiently)

Advantage of SVG is that u can scale the image to any amount of smallness without it corrupting it's data... the largest of the data can be magnifid to the smallest of images via SVG... 

ANd text processing is way easier and faster than image processing

Just find a way on how to put your pixels (rgb) into the svg.... and knowing how to make it downloadable or converting to png amy also be handy
