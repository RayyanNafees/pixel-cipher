1. Getting the numbers inside of a file

2. Raise the integer to a higher base

3. represent each character as a pixel value

4. Form an image

## Unciphering

1. Get the pixel values from an image

2. Convert them back to integers of base pixel

3. Convert integer base_pixel to base_10

4. Convert the base-10 integer back to bytes into the file
